# Welcome to the Evvrything public beta test
`Important notes`

1. To test, you would need a discord account. The app is currently invite only, and this is the place I can share you an invite code.  Bug finds are incentivised üôÇ. Our discord channel is -> https://discord.gg/VfCuKyZmpD
2. This app is a webapp (a website designed to look like an app), therefore you will not be able to install it from an AppStore.
However, the AppStore version for both iOS/Android are coming. üëç
3. As stated on the twitter announcement,  
```
We don't intend to kill excitement, but major functions in this version are disabled.

1. On 27th, only basic functions will be enabled.
- posts, reposts, likes, comments, updating a profile etc.
2. If All went well? We'll enable direct messaging.
3. If all still ok? then we'll enable trends

This lets us focus.
```


# Installation of a web-app

iOS install instructions here -> https://youtu.be/Bf0amooVZzo

Android installation -> https://youtu.be/BSVdXqHGXhs

Desktop computers -> The app will eventually run on desktop much like twitter.com, however the desktop layout is incomplete. If you still want to use the desktop version then adjust your chrome/firefox/safari browser to to a mobile screen size. If you do not do this, then you'll just see the site with its 40% incomplete layout. It still functions, but its not visually pretty.



# What we'll test today

We're all busy, so we'd hope you test at least the first 3 (below) and tell us your impression via discord.
